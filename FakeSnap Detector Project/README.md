# 🧠 FakeSnap Detector: Real vs AI-Generated Image Classifier

FakeSnap Detector is a deep learning-powered solution built to automatically classify images as either **authentic (real)** or **synthetically generated by AI**. With the rise of generative models such as GANs and diffusion models, distinguishing real imagery from fake is becoming crucial in areas like digital forensics, media integrity, and content verification.

This project leverages **transfer learning** with **MobileNetV2**, utilizing the **CIFAKE dataset**—a curated set of real and AI-generated images—to train a high-performance binary image classifier.
